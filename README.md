Models can be used for scatterers with cylinder form factor (Cyl) and interacting via electrostatic interactions (CH).
Models assume that cylinders form fractal-like networks (frac).
A resolution smeared data fitting option is also available (ResSm).
Model that includes salt effects is also included (salt).
